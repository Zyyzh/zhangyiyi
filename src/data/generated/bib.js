        "abstract": "In the past decade, the manufacturing environment has faced more challenges than ever since as a result of the increase of global competiveness and preferences of customer demands, which require developments of a resilient production system that is capable of providing essential flexibility and responsiveness to accommodate changes at an unpredictable circumstance. Human centred assembly systems, as an example, can offer such characteristics because of the nature of human intelligence and problem solving abilities. Nevertheless, human performance on a human centred assembly system is also largely affected by human factors during production. Ageing is one of human factors that may significantly affect human performance in completing assigned assembly tasks. When designing and analysing a human centred manufacturing system, such a human attribute is often inadequately represented in neither mathematical models nor computer-based simulation models and therefore the analysed outcomes using these approaches may not properly describe the real behaviour of the system. The result of the previous studies also indicates that human performance may start to decline from the age of 38 years old and beyond. This paper presents a study by investigating the influence of ageing on assembly worker performance using a learning curve approach. The different ageing cohorts were incorporated into a DES (discrete event simulation) model. The study concludes that worker productivity decreases by an average 1% per year as the age of workers increases from 38 to 70 years old.",

        "abstract": "Computer based discrete event simulation (DES) is one of the most commonly used aids for the design of automotive manufacturing systems. However, DES tools represent machines in extensive detail, while only representing workers as simple resources. This presents a problem when modelling systems with a highly manual work content, such as an assembly line. This paper describes research at Cranfield University, in collaboration with the Ford Motor Company, founded on the assumption that human variation is the cause of a large percentage of the disparity between simulation predictions and real world performance. The research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of simulation prediction by including models of human factors.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of the human component of complex systems is an important element of the design process at all stages. This paper outlines the application of task network modelling to the identification of critical subtasks in the interaction between man and machine. By applying the Integrated Performance Modelling Environment (IPME) tool developed by Micro Analysis and Design Inc. under contract to the UK Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) it is possible to consider the effects of both environmental stressors and workload in conjunction with subsystem performance. Under different operational conditions aspects of crew performance will be affected differentially. As a consequence, the aspects of system operation which lie on the critical path may change. The application of IPME to the analysis of a simple case study is described. By considering the variation of task performance with operational conditions, critical paths are identified and overall system performance quantified. The automation of specific system elements is investigated and it is shown that overall performance can be optimised whilst minimising the cost of modification.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research is to: (1) Develop an approach to integrating both human fatigue-recovery patterns and human learning into Discrete Event Simulation models of a production system to predict productivity and quality; (2) Validate the predicted fatigue against operators\u2019 perceived fatigue; and (3) Demonstrate how this Human Factors-enabled simulation approach can be applied in a case study comparing two manufacturing line designs in the context of electronics assembly. The new approach can predict the accumulation of operator fatigue, fatigue-related quality effects and productivity changes based on system design configurations. In the demonstration comparison, fatigue dosage was 7\u201333% lower in the proposed system where HF was taken into consideration at the engineering design (ED) stage. In the existing system, the fatigue dose measure correlated with quality deficits with 26% of the variance accounted for \u2013 a large portion given the multi-causal nature of production deficits. ED models that do not include human aspects may provide unreliable results in terms of productivity and quality estimates. This research shows that it is possible to design production systems that are more productive while being less hazardous for the system operator.",

        "abstract": "The process of manufacturing system design frequently includes modeling, and usually, this means applying a technique such as discrete event simulation (DES). However, the computer tools currently available to apply this technique enable only a superficial representation of the people that operate within the systems. This is a serious limitation because the performance of people remains central to the competitiveness of many manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, this paper explores the use of probability density functions to represent the variation of worker activity times within DES models.",

        "abstract": "Discrete-event simulation (DES) has been widely used in systems analysis. However, authors defend the idea that this kind of simulation does not properly represent the human element or the factors affecting its productivity. In Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), agents are intelligent, autonomous and proactive beings, which are features closely related to human behaviour. Therefore, ABS and DES were combined into one model to represent the human element as agents, who were subjected to one of the factors that affect their performance, the circadian rhythm. After statistical validation it was determined that the computer models integrating ABS and DES represent the productive systems under analysis with high level of confidence. A comparison between the model built and a DES model where operators are represented by resources was also performed. It was verified that the ABS/DES represents better the actual systems behaviour than the DES, showing a lower average of relative error.",

It is common practice to represent workers within these simulation models as simple resources, often using deterministic performance values derived from time studies. This form of representing the factory worker ignores the potentially large effect that human performance variation can have on system performance and it particularly affects the predictive capability of simulation models with a high proportion of manual tasks. The intentions of the chapter are twofold: firstly, to raise awareness of the importance of considering human performance variation in such simulation models and secondly, to present some conceptual ideas for developing a worker agent for representing worker performance in manufacturing systems simulation models.",

We apply agent-based modeling and simulation to investigate a set of problems in a retail context. Specifically, we are working to understand the relationship between people management practices on the shop-floor and retail performance. Despite the fact we are working within a relatively novel and complex domain, it is clear that using an agent-based approach offers great potential for improving organizational capabilities in the future.Our multi-disciplinary research team has worked closely with one of the UK\u2019s top ten retailers to collect data and build an understanding of shop-floor operations and the key actors in a department (customers, staff, and managers). Based on this case study we have built and tested our first version of a retail branch agent-based simulation model where we have focused on how we can simulate the effects of people management practices on customer satisfaction and sales. In our experiments we have looked at employee development and cashier empowerment as two examples of shopfloor management practices.In this paper we describe the underlying conceptual ideas and the features of our simulation model. We present a selection of experiments we have conducted in order to validate our simulation model and to show its potential for answering \u201cwhat-if questions in a retail context. We also introduce a novel performance measure which we have created to quantify customers\u2019 satisfaction with service, based on their individual shopping experiences.",

Deterministic simulation models often overestimate the production capacity of manufacturing systems since they don\u00b4t consider some key relationships, such as the impact of human factor performance on productivity. This paper, with the aid of statistical techniques, analyses the total of boards produced, taking into consideration different periods of work shifts to apprehend the variability of human performance at different points throughout the day.
